Evaluation
==========
Evaluation is crucial in machine learning to assess the reliability and effectiveness of prediction models.
We prioritize diverse, robust, and transparent evaluation techniques. This encompasses a range of strategies
addressing the unique challenges presented by different machine learning subfields, such as clustering and
positive-unlabeled learning.

The following sections provide more details for each relevant machine learning subfield:
