Introduction
============
**AAanalysis** is a Python framework designed for scientists and researchers focusing on interpretable sequence-based
protein prediction. Ideal for comparing protein sequences using amino acid scales, this toolkit is versatile enough
for any sequence analysis representable by numerical values.

Key Algorithms
--------------
- **CPP**: Comparative Physicochemical Profiling, an interpretable feature engineering algorithm comparing two sets of
  protein sequences to identify the set of most distinctive features.
- **dPULearn**: A deterministic Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning algorithm tailored for training on unbalanced and
  small datasets, enhancing predictive accuracy.
- **AAclust**: A k-optimized clustering wrapper that selects redundancy-reduced sets of numerical scales,
  such as amino acid scales.

Purpose and Audience
--------------------
Designed for (computational) biologists, AAanalysis facilitates the analysis and comparison of protein sequences.
It enables the discovery of physicochemical signatures that underlie biological interactions and functions.
