   Developer Note:

   This RST document lists references for the project, organized into four sections:

   1. **Algorithms**: For algorithm-based references.
   2. **Datasets and Benchmarks**: For dataset and benchmark tool references.
   3. **Use Cases**: Currently empty but reserved for application-related references.
   4. **Further Information**: For any additional, miscellaneous references.

   To add a new citation:

   1. Choose the appropriate section.
   2. Add a unique citation identifier (e.g., `[Breimann23a]`).
   3. Provide the full citation, followed by the optional link if available. Use the syntax `.. [CitationID]` for
   the citation and `` `Title <URL>`__ `` for the link.

   Make sure to update all related documents that need to reference the new citation.
